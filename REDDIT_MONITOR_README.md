## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

The monitoring system uses four main tables:

- **`reddit_monitors`**: Monitor configurations and settings
- **`reddit_posts`**: Found posts matching keywords
- **`reddit_comments`**: Found comments matching keywords  
- **`monitor_runs`**: Execution history and logs

### Key Components

- **`RedditClient`**: Handles Reddit API interactions with rate limiting
- **`MonitoringService`**: Manages scheduled monitoring and execution
- **`tRPC Router`**: Type-safe API endpoints for all operations
- **Cron Jobs**: Automated scheduling using node-cron

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Monitor Settings

| Setting | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Check Interval | How often to check for new content | 5-60 minutes |
| Subreddits | List of subreddits to monitor | Unlimited |
| Keywords | Keywords to search for | Unlimited |
| Active Status | Whether monitor is running | Boolean |

### Reddit API Settings

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | Reddit app client ID | Yes |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Reddit app client secret | Yes |
| `REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth refresh token | Optional* |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | User agent string | Yes |

*Required for automated monitoring; manual runs work without it.

## üö® Rate Limiting & Best Practices

### Reddit API Limits
- **100 requests/minute** with OAuth authentication
- **10 requests/minute** without OAuth
- **1 request/second** recommended to avoid issues

### Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 1-2 subreddits and a few keywords
2. **Reasonable Intervals**: Use 10+ minute intervals for new setups
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check execution history for errors
4. **Keyword Optimization**: Use specific, relevant keywords to reduce noise

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Reddit client not initialized"**
- Check your Reddit API credentials in `.env.local`
- Ensure `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
- Restart the application after updating environment variables

**"Monitor not finding results"**
- Verify subreddit names are correct (without r/ prefix)
- Check if keywords are too specific
- Try manual execution to test immediately

**Rate limit errors**
- Increase check intervals between monitors
- Reduce number of active monitors
- Check for multiple instances running

### Getting Help

1. **Setup Guide**: Visit `/reddit-monitor/setup` for detailed configuration steps
2. **API Documentation**: Check [Reddit API docs](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) for API-specific issues
3. **Community**: Visit [r/redditdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev) for Reddit API help

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **API Keys**: Never commit Reddit API credentials to version control
- **User Isolation**: Each user's monitors are completely isolated
- **Data Retention**: Configure data cleanup policies as needed
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse
